    <p>
    We are a young team made up of Data Scientist graduate students from the University of San Francisco. Our team came up with the idea of automatically generating video e-card after getting frustrated with complicated video editors and annoying card makers. Created from cutting-edge machine learning methods, MagiKard takes all the tapping, pinching, and clicking out to take the hassle out of the process.
